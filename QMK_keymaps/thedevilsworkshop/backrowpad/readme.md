# BackRowPad, by the Devil's Workshop

A 12-key linear macropad, designed to replace the back row of function keys or just be a stick of keys you can map to stuff.

There are no maintainers! I designed this macropad and I am not selling it as a product! But the design works and you can make your own if you want, so here it is.

## Features

- Keys
- Optional MX hotswap sockets (no choc support)
- A cool pattern on the switch plate and backplate
- Optional header for an RGB LED strip (use something narrow like Adafruit's narrow Neopixel strips)

## Bootloader

Use the 'RESET' button mounted on the bottom of the main PCB to reset your microcontroller and enter the bootloader as per its instructions. For RP2040 devices, this means having BOOTSELECT held down when the board resets.
